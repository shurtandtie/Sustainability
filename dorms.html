            <h2>Dorms at Northeastern</h2>
            <p>Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>
            <p>What does this look like in our day-to-day? </p><br><br>
        
            <p><b>Let's take a look at emissions from all student dorms at Northeastern in 2022.</b></p><br>
            
            <img src="images/dorms.png" width="60%" alt="This graph shows the emissions of each dorm in 2022 compared to BERDO standards.">
            <p>East village leads the pack in terms of emissions, with Stetson east following closely behind. </p><br>
            <p>The buildings that are leading contributors to our footprint are Egan Research Center, Stetson East, Hurtig Hall, Marino Recreation Cetner, and Mugar Life Sciences Building. These are all buildings with high traffic and thus high energy, from residence halls to gyms to science labs.</p><br>
            <p>We are working to decrease energy usage in these areas to meet our BERDO goals.</p><br><br>

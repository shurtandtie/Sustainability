     <h2>How is Northeastern University building a sustainable tomorrow?</h2>
    
         <h3>Our Green Mission</h3>
         <p>Welcome to Northeastern University! Our bustling campus is home to several large-scale services and resources; but sustainability is always front of mind.</p>

            </div>

         <p>From the dining halls to the academic buildings, Northeastern is committed to ensuring a robust system that considers sustainability efforts and maintenance. As transparency is a key priority, we have made accessible data that tells you how some of the buildings you frequent during your day are part of our sustainable ecosystem.</p>
    
    <h2>Let's take a walk through campus.</h2>
    
        <p>Along with high-level campus information about sustainability numbers and resources, we’ll also take a closer look at specific buildings, ones that are commonly accessed and essential to a Northeastern University student’s typical day.</p>
        
        <!--PLACE HOLDER ADD MAP-->
        
        <p>In this map on the left, users will be able to see at a high level, the distribution of emissions and food waste across campus. This is a Flourish map that will let the user interact with the map and hover over buildings to see individual rates. There will also be a toggle to switch between emissions data and food waste data, with separate color gradients.</p>

        <p>This map is not fully done yet. It will be embedded into the site to invite users to explore these areas of sustainability. This map represents the combination of our two main areas of focus.</p>

        <p>The intention here is to be very transparent about the current state of sustainability on campus.</p>

    <h3>Reducing Waste</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>International Village is the newest and largest dining hall at Northeastern University, featuring a range of cuisines.</p>

            <p>As Northeastern’s student population grows, the amount of food waste coming from its dining halls will increase. Although 2023’s data only accounts for half the year, it is already measuring at more than half of 2022.</p>

            <p>In 2021, not as many students may have been using the dining hall due to COVID-19.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that this data includes food waste from Cafe Crossing, a small cafe located in the same building. However, the size of the cafe is negligible compared to the dining hall.</p>

            <p>Stetson East and Stetson West are the two other dining halls on-campus. Like International Village, they are also home to dorms.</p>

            <p>As you can see, food waste from these two dining halls drops significantly during the summer, when they are often closed or operating with limited hours and services.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that this data also includes food waste from Outtakes, which is located in Stetson West. It also commonly frequented by students on meal plans.</p>

        <!--add chart with material identification-->
        <div class="text">
            <p>Material waste comes in a number of forms that have different modes of disposal, meaning there’s always room for improvement. Each item tends to fall under a certain disposal method, most popular being recycled. Not all is captured, leading to the high amount of ‘waste’ shown, which includes recyclable material that has either been misplaced in bins or contaminated in someway. Much of this confusion comes from misunderstandings about the waste process and how to properly dispose materials; making sure to have proper labeling and knowing the state’s rules can help distribute this weight into other categories away from landfills.</p>

            <p>General waste holds a significant percentage of our overall trash consumption despite improvements through the years, and isn’t necessarily decreasing. This means that even if we are reaching out facilities-wise for programs, we still need understanding on the individual scale to make sure they work well.</p>

            <p>Northeastern University has reduced its energy usage by 27% in the last two decades.</p>
    
            <p>The primary energy sources at Northeastern are diesel, gasoline, natural gas, distillate oil and electricity, with natural gas being the most consumed energy source on campus.</p>
    
            <p>From 2005 to 2021, there were decreases in gasoline, oil and electricity usage, specifically. There was also an increase in square footage throughout this time period by 1,500 square feet.</p> 
        
            <p>These factors ultimately led to the decreased rate in BTU per square foot.</p>

            <p>Matthews Arena is the oldest multipurpose sports arena in the world.</p>
    
            <p>Today at Northeastern University, it’s used for many sporting events, as well as large campus celebrations. It holds all the home hockey games in the winter and also is a venue for the annual Homecoming Concert and Commencement for the graduating class.</p>
        
            <p>The fall and wintertime definitely have the highest rates of electricity, aligning with the fall semester events like Convocation as well as winter sports season.</p>
    
            <p>Although the 2023 data is incomplete, with rates from October through December missing, there is already a general decrease in electricity that's evident from the last nine months. Compared to the last two years, there has been less electricity used to power Matthews Arena so far in 2023, suggesting a lower trajectory of electricity usage in the future. </p>

    <h3> Emissions at Northeastern </h3>
    <h3> From 2005 to 2022 </h3>
    
        <p> Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions. The following charts document a decrease in GHG emissions on Northeastern University's campus from 2005 to 2022. In the University's 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the University identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal, and outlined its strategy for achieving a 20% reduction in metric tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent/sqft of financially controlled space by 2015 when using 2005 as a baseline.</p>

    <h3>What are emission scopes? <sup>[1]</sup></h3>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
               
            <p> Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased 25% from 2005 to 2015. From 2015 to 2022, however, the total GHG emissions decreased by just 13% -- this suggests that the university's efforts in recent years at reducing emissions is only half as efficacious as it was in the previous decade. Upon closer inspection, we found that while scope 2 emissions from electricity use has been steadily declining, scope 1 emissions from campus-generated fuel sources has remained relatively stagnant following a promising initial decrease from 2005-2008. It is well known that fossil fuels are the largest contributor to global climate change and account for over 75% of global GHG emissions. Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator the university's sustained use of fossil fuels, natural gas and fuel oil, and points to an opportunity for a much-needed further decrease of on-campus GHG emissions in years to come. <sup>[8]</sup></p>

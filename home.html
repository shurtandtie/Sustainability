    <h1>Our Green Mission</h1>
    <p><b>Welcome to Northeastern University! </b>
        Our bustling campus is home to several large-scale services and resources, but our sustainability efforts are always front of mind.</p><br>
    
    <p>From the dining halls to the academic buildings, Northeastern is committed to ensuring a robust system that considers sustainability and maintenance. With transparency as a key priority, we have made accessible data that tells you how some of the buildings you frequent during your day are part of our sustainable ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Let's take a walk through campus.</h2>
    
        <p>Along with high-level campus information about sustainability numbers and resources, we’ll also take a closer look at specific buildings, ones that are commonly accessed and essential to a Northeastern University student’s typical day.</p>
    
    <br>

        <p>First, let's start with an overview of campus. Here, this map shows the distribution of emissions across campus.</p>

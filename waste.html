  <h2>Food Waste</h2>
    
    <p><b>Let's talk about dining.</b> Campus dining halls are an important part of student life but they can also generate high amounts of food waste. That's why Northeastern University partners with CERO Cooperative, a composting company based out of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Most — if not all — of the food waste generated by campus dining halls and eateries are regularly collected and composted by CERO.</p><br>

    <p>Northeastern University is home to three dining halls: International Village, Stetson West and Stetson East. Although we do not know the exact number of students using these facilities, we know they each services thousands of students throughout the day, everyday — and that number will only continue to grow.</p><br><br>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Images/Total Food Waste from International Village_Transparent.png" alt="This graph displayes the total fod waste from International Village between 2021, 2022 and 2023.">
        <img src="Images/Monthly Food Waste from Stetson East and Stetson West_Transparent.png" alt="This graph displayes the monthly food waste from Stetson East and Stetson West in 2022.">
    </div>
   
    <br><br>

    <p>International Village is the newest and largest dining hall at Northeastern University, featuring a range of cuisines. As you can see, although 2023's data only accounts for half the year, it is already measuring at more than half of 2022.</p><br>

    <p>Looking at the data from Stetson West and Stetson East, the amount of food waste clearly drops during holiday months when not as many students are using the dining halls.</p><br>
    
    <p>Note: The data for International Village includes food waste from Cafe Crossing and the data for Stetson West and Stetson East includes food waste from Outtakes. However, both Cafe Crossing and Outtakes account for a significantly small portion of the total food waste.</p>

        <p><b>How can you help reduce food waste at your favorite dining hall?</b></p>
        <p>You can always go back for more, but maybe you take smaller portions to reduce leftover waste. Keep in mind that each and every student, including you, can leave an impact on the food waste generated from the dining halls!</p>

    <h2>Material Waste</h2>
    
    <p><b>Aside from food waste, there's material waste.</b> Material waste comes in a number of forms that have different modes of disposal, meaning there’s always room for improvement.</p><br>
    <figure class = "imagerightcap">
      
          <img src="Images/Sustainability Game Sketches (2).png" alt="Material Waste Total by Year and Disposal Method">
          <figcaption><b>Each item tends to fall under a certain disposal method, most popular being recycled.</b><br><br>Not all is captured, leading to the high amount of ‘waste’ shown, which includes recyclable material that has either been misplaced in bins or contaminated in someway. Much of this confusion comes from misunderstandings about the waste process and how to properly dispose materials.<br><br>Making sure to have proper labeling and knowing the state’s rules can help distribute this weight into other categories away from landfills.</figcaption>
     </figure>
    <p><b>Below is another way to look at the distribution of material waste.</b> General waste holds a significant percentage of our overall trash consumption despite improvements through the years, and isn’t necessarily decreasing. This means that even if we are reaching out facilities-wise for programs, we still need understanding on the individual scale to make sure they work well.</p>

<h3>Let's talk about dining.</h3>
    <p>Let's talk about dining. Campus dining halls and other eateries are an important part of student life but they also generate high amounts of food waste. That is why Northeastern partners with CERO Cooperative, a composting company based out of Dorchester. Most — if not all — of the food waste generated around campus is regularly collected and composted by CERO.</p><br>
    <p>Northeastern is home to three dining halls: International Village, Stetson West and Stetson East. Although we do not know the exact number of students using these facilities, we know they each service thousands of students throughout the day, everyday. That number will only continue to grow, reinforcing the importance that our dining halls must be using sustainable methods.</p><br>

        <img src="images/Total_Food_Waste_from_International_Village_Transparent_final.png" alt="This graph displayes the total fod waste from International Village between 2021, 2022 and 2023.">
        <img src="images/Monthly_Food_Waste_from_Stetson_East_and_Stetson_West_Transparent_final.png" alt="This graph displayes the monthly food waste from Stetson East and Stetson West in 2022.">
    </div>
    <p>International Village is the newest and largest dining hall at Northeastern, featuring a range of cuisines. As you can see, although 2023's data only accounts for half the year, it is already measuring at more than half of 2022.</p><br>
    <p>Like International Village, Stetson West and Stetson East also double as residential dorms. Clearly, the amount of food waste from these dining halls drops during holiday months when not as many students are around.</p><br>
    <p>Through our research, we can understand some basic information about how much food waste is generated from the dining halls and therefore composted. However, it would be helpful to know how many students use each dining hall on a weekly basis to understand how the food waste grows with the student population. It also might be interesting to understand whether CERO collects contaminated waste they cannot compost, and what can be done to prevent that.</p>

    <p><b>How can you help reduce food waste at your favorite dining hall?</b></p>
    <p>You can always go back for more food, but maybe you take smaller portions to reduce leftover waste. Keep in mind that each and every student, including you, can leave an impact on the food waste generated from the dining halls!</p>

    <h2>Material Waste</h2>
    
    <p><b>Aside from food waste, there's material waste.</b> Material waste comes in a number of forms that have different modes of disposal, meaning there’s always room for improvement.</p><br>
   
    <br>

    <p><b>Each item tends to fall under a certain disposal method, most popular being recycled.</b> Not all is captured, leading to the high amount of ‘waste’ shown, which includes recyclable material that has either been misplaced in bins or contaminated in someway. Much of this confusion comes from misunderstandings about the waste process and how to properly dispose materials.<br><br>Making sure to have proper labeling and knowing the state’s rules can help distribute this weight into other categories away from landfills.</p>

    <p><b>Below is another way to look at the distribution of material waste.</b> General waste holds a significant percentage of our overall trash consumption despite improvements through the years, and isn’t necessarily decreasing. This means that even if we are reaching out facilities-wise for programs, we still need understanding on the individual scale to make sure they work well.</p>

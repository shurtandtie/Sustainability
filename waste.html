  <h2>Food and Material Waste</h2>

  <h3>Reducing Waste</h3>

          <p>International Village is the newest and largest dining hall at Northeastern University, featuring a range of cuisines.</p>

          <p>As Northeastern’s student population grows, the amount of food waste coming from its dining halls will increase. Although 2023’s data only accounts for half the year, it is already measuring at more than half of 2022.</p>

          <p>In 2021, not as many students may have been using the dining hall due to COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that this data includes food waste from Cafe Crossing, a small cafe located in the same building. However, the size of the cafe is negligible compared to the dining hall.</p>

      <div class="text">
          <p>Stetson East and Stetson West are the two other dining halls on-campus. Like International Village, they are also home to dorms.</p>

          <p>As you can see, food waste from these two dining halls drops significantly during the summer, when they are often closed or operating with limited hours and services.</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that this data also includes food waste from Outtakes, which is located in Stetson West. It also commonly frequented by students on meal plans.</p>

      <!--add chart with material identification-->
      <div class="text">
          <p>Material waste comes in a number of forms that have different modes of disposal, meaning there’s always room for improvement. Each item tends to fall under a certain disposal method, most popular being recycled. Not all is captured, leading to the high amount of ‘waste’ shown, which includes recyclable material that has either been misplaced in bins or contaminated in someway. Much of this confusion comes from misunderstandings about the waste process and how to properly dispose materials; making sure to have proper labeling and knowing the state’s rules can help distribute this weight into other categories away from landfills.</p>

      <div class="text">
          <p>General waste holds a significant percentage of our overall trash consumption despite improvements through the years, and isn’t necessarily decreasing. This means that even if we are reaching out facilities-wise for programs, we still need understanding on the individual scale to make sure they work well.</p>

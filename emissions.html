        <h2>Zooming out: <br> Campuswide Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>

        <p><b>Let's track our footprint.</b> Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>

        <p>In the University's 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the University identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal, and outlined its strategy for achieving a 20% reduction in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot of financially controlled space by 2015 when using 2005 as a baseline.</p><br>

    <p><b>Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased 25% in the ten years between 2005 to 2015.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>From 2015 to 2022, however, the total GHG emissions decreased by just 13%. This suggests that the university's efforts in recent years at reducing emissions is only half as efficacious as it was in the previous decade.</p><br>

        <br><br><pc>Carbon dioxide comprises 99% of all of Northeastern's greenhouse gas emissions. If we look at the larger context, this data makes sense â€“ carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2021, CO2 accounted for 79% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.<sup>[3](EPA)</sup><br>Carbon dioxide is created through burning of fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity.

        <h2>Scope 1 and 2 Emissions</h2>
        
        <p><b>Let's break this down even further.</b> When tracking our emissions, it's important to note the categories of emissions, or scopes.</p><br>
        
        <p>Scope 1 emissions are directly caused by energy sources that an organization owns, so for us that means our sources of fuel and power. Scope 2 emissions are indirect, as a result of energy sources that are bought, such as electricity. Here is a graphic by the National Grid for further explanation of GHG emissions scopes.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Analyzing NEU's emissions by scope:</h3>
        <p>Upon closer inspection, we found that while Scope 2 emissions from electricity use has been steadily declining, Scope 1 emissions from campus-generated fuel sources has remained relatively stagnant following a promising initial decrease from 2005-2008.</p>

        <div class="image_captions">Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator of the university's sustained use of natural gas and fuel oil. <br>Here, we recognize the opportunity for a much-needed further decrease of on-campus GHG emissions in years to come. <br>Data from Northeastern University Sustainability Hub from 2005 to 2022.</div><br><br>        </div>

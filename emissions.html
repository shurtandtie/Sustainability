        <h2>Let's track our footprint.</h2>
        <p>Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>
        <p>In Northeastern’s 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the university identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal. Using campus emission levels from 2005 as a baseline, NEU set out to reduce emissions by 20%  by 2015 and pledged to further reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.<sup>[6]</sup></p><br>
        <p>On a more granular level, the plan defined emissions as <i>metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot of financially controlled space (MTCDE)</i>, and our website will continue to use this definition and unit of label when referring to emissions at Northeastern.</p><br>

        <p>Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased <b>25%</b> in the ten years between 2005 to 2015. This means that Northeastern went above and beyond its goals for 2015 in the 2010 Sustainable Action Plan!

                <br><br>Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator of the university's sustained use of natural gas and fuel oil. Here, we recognize the opportunity for further decrease in campus greenhouse gas emissions in years to come.

        <p>Traditionally, electricity is generated at power plants all over the country and transported over hundreds of miles of wires to the end-users of that electricity. This process often results in line-losses, or electricity lost in travel.<sup>[7]</sup>  
            <br><br>
            Between 2018 to 2022, annual electricity transmission and distribution losses averaged about 5% of the electricity transmitted and distributed in the country.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br><br><b>Enter: microgrids. </b>Microgrids, true to their name, are smaller, localized networks of generators that produce electricity for a specific subset of end-use customers.<sup>[1]</sup> In contrast to traditional electricity grids, microgrids serve a more local network, resulting in less electricity lost in travel, lower cost, and reduced emissions.<sup>[1]</sup>

        <p> Does Northeastern’s reduction in scope 2 emissions reveal a decrease in electricity use, or is our electricity being generated in a less emissions-heavy method? <br><br>

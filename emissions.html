    <h2>Let's track our footprint.</h2>
    <p>Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>
    <p>In Northeastern’s 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the university identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal. Using campus emission levels from 2005 as a baseline, NEU set out to reduce emissions by 20%  by 2015 and pledged to further reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.<sup>[6]</sup></p><br>
    <p>On a more granular level, the plan defined emissions as metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot of financially controlled space (MTCDE), and our website will continue to use this definition and unit of label when referring to emissions at Northeastern.</p><br>

    <h3>From 2005 to 2022: Annual campus emissions</h3>
    <p>Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased 25% in the ten years between 2005 to 2015. This means that Northeastern went above and beyond its goals for 2015 in the 2010 Sustainable Action Plan! 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>From 2015 to 2022, however, our total GHG emissions decreased by just 13%. This raises questions about whether the university's efforts at reducing emissions in recent years have been as effective as it was in the previous decade.

            <pc> In 2017, the university experienced a prolonged power outage, resulting in a weeklong electricity outage at its residence halls.<sup>[8]</sup> Two years later, the university began development of a microgrid to ensure more reliable power, lower electricity costs, and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.<sup>[8]</sup> 
            <br><br>Traditionally, electricity is generated at power plants all over the country and transported over hundreds of miles of wires to the end-users of that electricity. This process often results in line-losses, or electricity lost in travel.<sup>[7]</sup>

    <p> Does Northeastern’s reduction in scope 2 emissions reveal a decrease in electricity use, or is our electricity being generated in a less emissions-heavy method? <br><br>

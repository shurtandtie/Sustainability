        <h2>Zooming out: <br> Campuswide Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>

        <p><b>Let's track our footprint.</b> Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>

        <p>In the University's 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the University identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal, and outlined its strategy for achieving a 20% reduction in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot of financially controlled space by 2015 when using 2005 as a baseline.</p><br>

        <p>From 2015 to 2022, however, the total GHG emissions decreased by just 13%. This suggests that the university's efforts in recent years at reducing emissions is only half as efficacious as it was in the previous decade.</p><br>
        
        <p>The buildings that are leading contributors to our footprint are Egan Research Center, Stetson East, Hurtig Hall, Marino Recreation Cetner, and Mugar Life Sciences Building. These are all buildings with high traffic and thus high energy, from residence halls to gyms to science labs.</p><br>
        <p>We are working to decrease energy usage in these areas to meet our BERDO goals.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Scope 1 and 2 Emissions</h2>
        
        <p><b>Let's break this down even further.</b> When tracking our emissions, it's important to note the categories of emissions, or scopes.</p><br>
        
        <p>Scope 1 emissions are directly caused by energy sources that an organization owns, so for us that means our sources of fuel and power. Scope 2 emissions are indirect, as a result of energy sources that are bought, such as electricity. Here is a graphic by the National Grid for further explanation of GHG emissions scopes.</p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <img src="images/ResponsibleBusinessCharter_UnderstandingGHGEmissions.png" alt="Emission scope graphic" width="80%">
        </div>
        
        <br><br>

        <p>Upon closer inspection, we found that while Scope 2 emissions from electricity use has been steadily declining, Scope 1 emissions from campus-generated fuel sources has remained relatively stagnant following a promising initial decrease from 2005-2008.</p>

        <figcaption>Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator the university's sustained use of fossil fuels, natural gas and fuel oil, and points to an opportunity for a much-needed further decrease of on-campus GHG emissions in years to come. </figcaption>

        <h3>Let's track our footprint.</h3>

        <p>Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>

        <p>In Northeastern’s 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the university identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal. Using campus emission levels from 2005 as a baseline, NEU set out to reduce emissions by 20%  by 2015 and pledged to further reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.<sup>[6]</sup></p><br>

        <p>On a more granular level, the plan defined emissions as metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot of financially controlled space (MTCDE), and our website will continue to use this definition and unit of label when referring to emissions at Northeastern. </p>

    <h3><b>Annual Campus Emissions from 2005 to 2022</b></h3>
    <p>Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased 25% in the ten years between 2005 to 2015. This means that Northeastern went above and beyond its goals for 2015 in the 2010 Sustainable Action Plan! 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>From 2015 to 2022, however, our total GHG emissions decreased by just 13%. This raises questions about whether the university's efforts at reducing emissions in recent years have been as effective as it was in the previous decade.

     <h2>Analyzing NEU's emissions by scope</h2>
        
        <p><b>Let's break this down even further.</b> When tracking our emissions, it's important to note the categories of emissions, or scopes, as they are an indicator of where the emissions are generated.        </p><br>
        <div class="columncontainer">
            <div class="column">
                <pc>Scope 1 emissions are directly caused by energy sources that an organization owns. At Northeastern, the majority of our scope 1 emissions come from consumption of natural gas for heating and fuel for our vehicle fleet.<sup>[3]</sup></pc> 
                </div>
            <div class="column">
                <pc>Scope 2 emissions refer to those resulting from energy sources that are bought, such as electricity. Northeastern purchases our electricity from ISO New England’s grid. Scope 2 emissions occur at the facility where they are generated, but we include them in our calculation of NEU’s GHG inventory because they are generated as a result of the university’s energy use.<sup>[3]</sup></pc>

            Here is a graphic by the Environmental Protection Agency for further explanation of GHG emissions scopes.

        <p>While scope 2 emissions from electricity use have been steadily declining, scope 1 emissions from campus-generated fuel sources have remained relatively stagnant following a promising initial decrease from 2005-2008.         </p>

            <p>Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator of the university's sustained use of natural gas and fuel oil. Here, we recognize the opportunity for a much-needed further decrease of on-campus GHG emissions in years to come.

            <pc> In 2017, the university experienced a prolonged power outage, resulting in a weeklong electricity outage at its residence halls.<sup>[8]</sup> Two years later, the university began development of a microgrid to ensure more reliable power, lower electricity costs, and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.<sup>[8]</sup> 
            <br><br>Traditionally, electricity is generated at power plants all over the country and transported over hundreds of miles of wires to the end-users of that electricity. This process often results in line-losses, or electricity lost in travel.<sup>[7]</sup>

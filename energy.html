        <h2>Energy Conservation</h2>
        
    
        <p><b>Let's talk about electricity and power sources.</b></p><br>
        
        <p>The primary energy sources at Northeastern are diesel, gasoline, natural gas, distillate oil and electricity, with natural gas being the most consumed energy source on campus.</p><br>
        
        <p>Northeastern University has reduced its energy usage by 27% in the last two decades.</p><br>
        
        <p>From 2005 to 2021, there were decreases in gasoline, oil and electricity usage, specifically. There was also an increase in square footage throughout this time period by 1,500 square feet.</p><br>
        
        <p>These factors ultimately led to the decreased rate in BTU per square foot.</p><br><br>

        <p><b>Let's look at one of its most historic buildings: Matthews Arena.</b></p>
        <p>This is also the oldest multipurpose sports arena in the world.</p>    
        <p>Today at Northeastern University, itâ€™s used for many sporting events, as well as large campus celebrations. It holds all the home hockey games in the winter and also is a venue for the annual Homecoming Concert and Commencement for the graduating class.</p>
        
        <img src="images/Matthews_Electricity2.png" width="70%" alt="Matthews Arena electricity data">
        
        <p>The fall and wintertime definitely have the highest rates of electricity, aligning with the fall semester events like Convocation as well as winter sports season.</p>

        <p>Although the 2023 data is incomplete, with rates from October through December missing, there is already a general decrease in electricity that's evident from the last nine months.</p> 
        <p>Compared to the last two years, there has been less electricity used to power Matthews Arena so far in 2023, suggesting a lower trajectory of electricity usage in the future. </p>

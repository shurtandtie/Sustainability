<h1>A Cleaner Campus</h1>
<h2>How is Northeastern University building a sustainable tomorrow?</h2>
    
<h3>Our Green Mission</h3>
<p>Welcome to Northeastern University! Our bustling campus is home to several large-scale services and resources; but sustainability is always front of mind.

<div class="text">
    <p>From the dining halls to the academic buildings, Northeastern is committed to ensuring a robust system that considers sustainability efforts and maintenance. As transparency is a key priority, we have made accessible data that tells you how some of the buildings you frequent during your day are part of our sustainable ecosystem.</p>
</div>
    
<h2>Let's take a walk through campus.</h2>
    
<p>Along with high-level campus information about sustainability numbers and resources, we’ll also take a closer look at specific buildings, ones that are commonly accessed and essential to a Northeastern University student’s typical day.</p>

<p>In this map on the left, users will be able to see at a high level, the distribution of emissions and food waste across campus. This is a Flourish map that will let the user interact with the map and hover over buildings to see individual rates. There will also be a toggle to switch between emissions data and food waste data, with separate color gradients.</p>

<p>This map is not fully done yet. It will be embedded into the site to invite users to explore these areas of sustainability. This map represents the combination of our two main areas of focus.</p>

<p>The intention here is to be very transparent about the current state of sustainability on campus.</p>

<h3>Offsetting Emissions and Conserving Energy</h3>

</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Northeastern University has reduced its energy usage by 27% in the last two decades.</p>

    <p>The primary energy sources at Northeastern are diesel, gasoline, natural gas, distillate oil and electricity, with natural gas being the most consumed energy source on campus.</p>

    <p>From 2005 to 2021, there were decreases in gasoline, oil and electricity usage, specifically. There was also an increase in square footage throughout this time period by 1,500 square feet.</p> 
    
    <p>These factors ultimately led to the decreased rate in BTU per square foot.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Matthews Arena</h3>

</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Matthews Arena is the oldest multipurpose sports arena in the world.</p>

    <p>Today at Northeastern University, it’s used for many sporting events, as well as large campus celebrations. It holds all the home hockey games in the winter and also is a venue for the annual Homecoming Concert and Commencement for the graduating class.</p>
    
    <p>The fall and wintertime definitely have the highest rates of electricity, aligning with the fall semester events like Convocation as well as winter sports season.</p>

    <p>Although the 2023 data is incomplete, with rates from October through December missing, there is already a general decrease in electricity that's evident from the last nine months. Compared to the last two years, there has been less electricity used to power Matthews Arena so far in 2023, suggesting a lower trajectory of electricity usage in the future. </p>

    <h2>Let's talk about electricity and power sources.</h2>
        
        <p>The primary energy sources at Northeastern are <b>diesel, gasoline, natural gas, distillate oil and electricity</b>, with natural gas being the most consumed energy source on campus.</p><br>
        
        <p><b>Northeastern University has reduced its energy usage by 19% in the last two decades.</b></p><br>
        
        <p>From 2005 to 2021, there were decreases in gasoline, oil and electricity usage, specifically. There was also an increase in square footage throughout this time period by 1,500 square feet.</p><br>
        
        <p>These factors ultimately led to the decreased rate in BTU per square foot.</p>

        <p><b>Now, let's look at one of its most historic buildings: Matthews Arena.</b></p>
        <p>This is also the oldest multipurpose sports arena in the world.</p>    
        <p>Today at Northeastern University, it’s used for many sporting events, as well as large campus celebrations. It holds all the home hockey games in the winter and also is a venue for the annual Homecoming Concert and Commencement for the graduating class.</p>

        <p>The fall and wintertime definitely have the highest rates of electricity, aligning with the fall semester events like Convocation as well as winter sports season.</p>

        <p>Although the 2023 data is incomplete, with rates from October through December missing, there is already a general decrease in electricity that's evident from the last nine months. Compared to the last two years, there has been less electricity used to power Matthews Arena so far in 2023, suggesting a lower trajectory of electricity usage in the future. </p>

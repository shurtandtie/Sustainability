                The top six buildings contributing to our carbon footprint are Egan Engineering/Science Research Center, Stetson East, Hurtig Hall, Marino Recreation Center, Mugar Life Sciences Building, and Behrakis Health Sciences Center. These are all high-traffic buildings central to student life, where students live, study, and socialize. 
                <br><br>
                What do you notice about these buildings? Two thirds of these buildings house science labs engaging in energy-intensive research. Stetson East is both a dining hall and a residence hall, and Marino Recreation Center is a multipurpose fitness and recreation facility.   </pc>

    <h2>Let's talk about electricity and power sources.</h2>
        
        <p>The primary energy sources at Northeastern are <b>diesel, gasoline, natural gas, distillate oil and electricity</b>, with natural gas being the most consumed energy source on campus.</p><br>
        
        <p>Northeastern University has reduced its energy usage by 19% in the last two decades.</p><br>
        
        <p>From 2005 to 2021, there were decreases in gasoline, oil and electricity usage, specifically. There was also an increase in square footage throughout this time period by 1,500 square feet.</p><br>
        
        <p>These factors ultimately led to the decreased rate in BTU per square foot.</p><br><br>

        <p><b>Let's look at one of its most historic buildings: Matthews Arena.</b></p>
        <p>This is also the oldest multipurpose sports arena in the world.</p>    
        <p>Today at Northeastern University, it’s used for many sporting events, as well as large campus celebrations. It holds all the home hockey games in the winter and also is a venue for the annual Homecoming Concert and Commencement for the graduating class.</p>
        
        <img src="images/Matthews_Electricity2.png" width="70%" alt="Matthews Arena electricity data">
        
        <p>The fall and wintertime definitely have the highest rates of electricity, aligning with the fall semester events like Convocation as well as winter sports season.</p>

        <p>Although the 2023 data is incomplete, with rates from October through December missing, there is already a general decrease in electricity that's evident from the last nine months.</p> 
        <p>Compared to the last two years, there has been less electricity used to power Matthews Arena so far in 2023, suggesting a lower trajectory of electricity usage in the future. </p>

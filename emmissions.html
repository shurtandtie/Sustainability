      <h1> Emissions at Northeastern </h1>
      <h2> From 2005 to 2022 </h2>

      <p> Northeastern's path to reducing its carbon footprint began in 2005, when it began tracking its annual greenhouse gas emissions. The following charts document a decrease in GHG emissions on Northeastern University's campus from 2005 to 2022. In the University's 2010 Sustainable Action Plan, the University identified carbon neutrality as its long-term goal, and outlined its strategy for achieving a 20% reduction in metric tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent/sqft of financially controlled space by 2015 when using 2005 as a baseline.      </p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>National Grid</i>, A brief explanation of GHG emission scopes.</div> 

      <p> Current data indicates that total GHG emissions decreased 25% from 2005 to 2015. From 2015 to 2022, however, the total GHG emissions decreased by just 13% -- this suggests that the university's efforts in recent years at reducing emissions is only half as efficacious as it was in the previous decade. Upon closer inspection, we found that while scope 2 emissions from electricity use has been steadily declining, scope 1 emissions from campus-generated fuel sources has remained relatively stagnant following a promising initial decrease from 2005-2008. It is well known that fossil fuels are the largest contributor to global climate change and account for over 75% of global GHG emissions. Scope 1 emissions, which remain high today, serves as an indicator the university's sustained use of fossil fuels, natural gas and fuel oil, and points to an opportunity for a much-needed further decrease of on-campus GHG emissions in years to come. <sup>[8]</sup></p>

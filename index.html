        <p><b>Welcome to Northeastern University!</b> Our bustling Boston campus is home to several large-scale services and resources, but our sustainability efforts are always front of mind. We wanted to know: <b><i>How is Northeastern taking steps toward a sustainable future?</i></b></p>
        <p>From the dining halls to the academic buildings, Northeastern is committed to a robust system that prioritizes sustainability and maintenance. Transparency is very important to us. Our team has dug through several datasets, from waste to emissions, and carried out accompanying research to paint a comprehensive picture of what our efforts look like.</p>

    <h2>Let's take a walk through campus.</h2>
    <p>As you go through this website, you will see accessible visualizations and insights that share how some of the buildings you frequent are part of our sustainable ecosystem. Every student can make a difference. We encourage you to think about how your actions can make a difference in your campus community.</p><br>
    <p>Along with high-level campus information about sustainability numbers and resources, we’ll also take a closer look at specific buildings, ones that are commonly accessed and essential to a Northeastern University student’s typical day.</p><br>
    <p>First, let's start with an overview of campus. Here, this map shows the distribution of emissions across campus.</p><br>

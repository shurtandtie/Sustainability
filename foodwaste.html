<h1>A Cleaner Campus</h1>
<h2>How is Northeastern University building a sustainable tomorrow?</h2>
    
<h3>Our Green Mission</h3>
<p>Welcome to Northeastern University! Our bustling campus is home to several large-scale services and resources; but sustainability is always front of mind.

From the dining halls to the academic buildings, Northeastern is committed to ensuring a robust system that considers sustainability efforts and maintenance. As transparency is a key priority, we have made accessible data that tells you how some of the buildings you frequent during your day are part of our sustainable ecosystem.</p>
    
<h2>Let's take a walk through campus.</h2>
    
<p>Along with high-level campus information about sustainability numbers and resources, we’ll also take a closer look at specific buildings, ones that are commonly accessed and essential to a Northeastern University student’s typical day.</p>

<p>In this map on the left, users will be able to see at a high level, the distribution of emissions and food waste across campus. This is a Flourish map that will let the user interact with the map and hover over buildings to see individual rates. There will also be a toggle to switch between emissions data and food waste data, with separate color gradients.</p>

<p>This map is not fully done yet. It will be embedded into the site to invite users to explore these areas of sustainability. This map represents the combination of our two main areas of focus.</p>

<p>The intention here is to be very transparent about the current state of sustainability on campus.</p>

<h3>Reducing Waste</h3>

<div class="text">
    <p>International Village is the newest and largest dining hall at Northeastern University, featuring a range of cuisines.</p>

    <p>As Northeastern’s student population grows, the amount of food waste coming from its dining halls will increase. Although 2023’s data only accounts for half the year, it is already measuring at more than half of 2022.</p>

    <p>In 2021, not as many students may have been using the dining hall due to COVID-19.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that this data includes food waste from Cafe Crossing, a small cafe located in the same building. However, the size of the cafe is negligible compared to the dining hall.</p>

</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Stetson East and Stetson West are the two other dining halls on-campus. Like International Village, they are also home to dorms.</p>

    <p>As you can see, food waste from these two dining halls drops significantly during the summer, when they are often closed or operating with limited hours and services.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that this data also includes food waste from Outtakes, which is located in Stetson West. It also commonly frequented by students on meal plans.</p>
